## Tech Stack

This portfolio is intentionally minimalist, prioritizing **performance**, **maintainability**, and **simplicity** over framework complexity.

### Core Technologies

- **Static HTML/CSS** - Single-file architecture (`index.html`) with inline CSS for zero build overhead and maximum performance
- **Oswald Google Font** - Bold, modern typeface from Google Fonts for heading typography
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first CSS with media queries supporting desktop (768px+), tablet, and mobile (480px, 360px) breakpoints
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Design system variables for colors, typography, spacing, and layout consistency
- **Semantic HTML5** - Accessible markup with proper meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter Card support

### Deployment & Infrastructure

- **GitHub Pages** - Static site hosting with custom domain support
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys on every push to `main`
- **Custom Domain** - Professional branding via `abediaz.ai` with DNS configuration through CNAME

### Design Philosophy

**Why static HTML?**
- ⚡ **Performance** - Near-instant page loads with no JavaScript framework overhead
- 🔒 **Security** - Minimal attack surface with no backend or database
- 💰 **Cost** - Free hosting via GitHub Pages
- 🛠️ **Simplicity** - Easy to maintain, update, and understand
- ♿ **Accessibility** - Works everywhere, including low-bandwidth connections and assistive technologies

This architecture demonstrates that not every project needs a complex framework—sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.
