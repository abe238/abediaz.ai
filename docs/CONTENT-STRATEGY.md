## Overview

### Purpose

This content strategy documentation serves to:

- **Clarify the relationship** between documentation in `docs/` and the live website (`index.html`)
- **Establish a source of truth** for profile and professional information
- **Provide clear mapping** between content sources and website sections
- **Define maintenance workflows** for keeping content synchronized and up-to-date
- **Document content philosophy** for each format (comprehensive vs. minimalist)

### Content Philosophy

The abediaz.ai website follows a **dual-content strategy**:

1. **Website (index.html)**: Minimalist, personal narrative approach
   - Focus on human story and personality
   - Conversational tone and storytelling
   - Selective professional details
   - Emphasis on personal interests and philosophy

2. **Profile Documentation (docs/)**: Comprehensive professional reference
   - Complete work history and timeline
   - Quantified impact and achievements
   - Skills taxonomy and expertise areas
   - Awards, press coverage, and recognition

These two formats serve different purposes and intentionally maintain different levels of detail.
