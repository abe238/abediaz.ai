# Git LFS consideration
# If this project grows to include many large images (>5MB each),
# consider enabling Git LFS for image files:
# *.jpg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.jpeg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.webp filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#
# For now, all images should be optimized to <500KB per IMAGES.md guidelines,
# so Git LFS is not necessary.
