# Create content strategy documentation linking docs/ to website sections

## Overview

The docs/ folder contains multiple content versions (website-content.md, website-content-ai-leadership.md, website-content-ai-leadership-v2.md) but there's no documentation explaining which content is current, what each version represents, or how docs relate to the live site.

## Rationale

The content strategy documents are valuable research but their relationship to the actual index.html is unclear. The site's current content differs significantly from the docs/website-content-ai-leadership-v2.md which is marked as the latest version. A mapping document would help maintain consistency.
