# Build Progress: Content Strategy Documentation

## 2026-01-01 - Planning Phase

### Initial Analysis Complete
- Reviewed spec.md requirements
- Explored project structure

### Key Findings:
1. **docs/ folder** contains only `abe-diaz-profile.md` (comprehensive profile document)
2. **index.html** is the live website with different content subset
3. The spec mentions historical content versions (website-content.md, website-content-ai-leadership*.md) but these no longer exist in the codebase - they may have been consolidated into abe-diaz-profile.md

### Current Content State:
- `docs/abe-diaz-profile.md` - Complete profile with 11 sections (Identity, Professional Summary, Impact, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Open Source, Volunteering, Press, Personal, Social)
- `index.html` - Minimalist personal site with About Me bio, profile image, flight stats, contact links
- Significant content in docs/ is NOT on the website (detailed work history, awards, skills, etc.)

### Implementation Plan Created:
- Phase 1: Research & Analysis (3 subtasks)
- Phase 2: Content Strategy Documentation (4 subtasks)
- Phase 3: Validation & Cleanup (2 subtasks)
- Total: 9 subtasks

### Next Steps:
- Begin Phase 1: Detailed content analysis
- Create CONTENT-STRATEGY.md in docs/ folder
