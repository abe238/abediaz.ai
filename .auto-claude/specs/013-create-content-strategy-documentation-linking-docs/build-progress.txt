# Build Progress - Content Strategy Documentation

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ Phase 1: Research & Analysis

#### 1.1 - Analyze docs/abe-diaz-profile.md content structure
**Status:** Completed
**Findings:**
- Documented all 11 sections of abe-diaz-profile.md
- Sections: Identity, Professional Summary, Impact & Achievements, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Open Source, Volunteering, Press & Publications, Personal, and Social Links

## Notes & Observations

### Content Strategy Insights
1. **Minimalist Philosophy**: The website intentionally shows only 30% of available content, focusing on narrative over data
2. **Source of Truth**: abe-diaz-profile.md is established as the authoritative source for all professional information
3. **Maintenance Challenge**: Job title needs to be updated across multiple locations (meta description, bio paragraph)
4. **Strategic Opportunity**: GitHub link from profile could enhance developer presence on website

### Documentation Quality
- All mapping tables include specific line numbers for easy reference
- Alignment status uses consistent emoji indicators (✅ ⚠️ ❌)
- Reasons for exclusion provide context for future decisions
- Tables support both maintenance (what to update) and strategy (what to potentially add)

### Technical Implementation
- Comprehensive mapping enables automated content sync in the future
- Clear traceability between sources and outputs
- Documentation structure supports both human readers and potential tooling
