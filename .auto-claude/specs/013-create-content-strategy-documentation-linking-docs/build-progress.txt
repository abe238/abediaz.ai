- **Profile contains 70%** more comprehensive data (~70% unused)
- **Philosophy**: Website follows minimalist personal narrative vs comprehensive resume

#### 2. Content Flow & Authority
```
abe-diaz-profile.md (PRIMARY) → index.html (SECONDARY)
      ↓                              ↓
100% comprehensive data         30% curated narrative
Source of truth for facts       Public presentation layer
```

#### 3. Mapping Coverage
- **34 website elements** mapped to sources (100% coverage)
- **32 elements** sourced from abe-diaz-profile.md (94%)
- **2 elements** are custom website additions (navigation, headers)
- **28+ profile elements** intentionally excluded from website (70% of profile)

#### 4. Content Alignment Status
- ✅ **Match**: 30 elements correctly aligned
- ⚠️ **Outdated**: 2 critical elements (job title in meta description and bio paragraph)
- ❌ **Missing**: 1 element (GitHub link should be added to website)
- **Custom**: 2 elements (navigation structure, section headers)

#### 5. Critical Discrepancies Identified

**🔴 CRITICAL - Job Title Mismatch** (2 locations)
- **Profile shows**: "Sr. Manager - Disaster Relief" (current as of Feb 2025)
- **Website shows**: "Sr. Technical Program Manager" (outdated)
- **Locations**: Line 7 (meta description), Line 576 (main bio paragraph)
- **Impact**: Public-facing content contradicts authoritative source

**⚠️ MINOR - Missing GitHub Link**
- **Profile has**: GitHub link in Social Links section
- **Website missing**: GitHub not included in footer social links
- **Opportunity**: Would enhance developer presence

#### 6. Content Strategy Insights

**Two Distinct Purposes**:
1. **abe-diaz-profile.md**: Complete professional record (resume-style, data-focused)
2. **index.html**: Personal brand narrative (story-focused, selective presentation)

**Content Selection Philosophy**:
- Website intentionally excludes: detailed work history, skills taxonomy, achievements metrics, volunteering, press coverage, open source projects
- Website focuses on: core identity, current role, personal philosophy, interests, contact
- Strategy: "Show personality and approachability, link to comprehensive data as needed"

#### 7. Maintenance Complexity
- **Update scenarios**: 3 distinct workflows based on content type
- **Sync requirements**: Updates must be synchronized within 24 hours
- **Decision points**: Need to determine docs-first vs website-first for each update
- **Quality verification**: 4-stage checklist required for every update

### Recommendations for Future Content Management

#### 🎯 Immediate Actions (Within 1 Week)

1. **Fix Critical Job Title Discrepancy**
   - Update index.html line 7 (meta description): Change "Sr. Technical Program Manager" to "Sr. Manager - Disaster Relief"
   - Update index.html line 576 (bio paragraph): Update current role description
   - Verify alignment with abe-diaz-profile.md after changes
   - **Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Public content accuracy

2. **Consider Adding GitHub Link**
   - Review if GitHub link from profile should be added to website footer
   - Decision: Does it align with minimalist philosophy?
   - If yes: Add to footer social links section (around line 596)
   - **Priority**: ⚠️ MINOR - Brand enhancement

#### 📋 Short-Term Improvements (Within 1 Month)

3. **Establish Routine Sync Checks**
   - **Weekly**: Spot-check alignment using CONTENT-STRATEGY.md mapping table
   - **Monthly**: Full content audit comparing profile to website
   - **Quarterly**: Strategic review of what content is/isn't displayed
   - Use the Content Synchronization Checklist in CONTENT-STRATEGY.md

4. **Set Up Update Reminders**
   - Calendar reminder: "Check content sync" every Monday
   - Post-update reminder: "Did you update BOTH sources?" after any change
   - Quarterly reminder: "Review content strategy alignment"

5. **Document Next Content Evolution**
   - Update Version History in CONTENT-STRATEGY.md when job changes occur
   - Document reasons for any new content additions/removals
   - Maintain audit trail of strategic decisions

#### 🔧 Medium-Term Enhancements (Within 3 Months)

6. **Consider Automation Opportunities**
   - Potential: Script to validate line number mappings still accurate
   - Potential: Automated check for profile.md updates that need website sync
   - Potential: Git hook to remind about dual-source updates
   - **Trade-off**: Effort vs benefit given low update frequency

7. **Expand Content Strategy Documentation**
   - Add examples of past content updates with before/after
   - Document decision-making process for content selection
   - Create "Content Addition Criteria" checklist
   - Build library of approved bio variations for different contexts

8. **Implement Version Control Best Practices**
   - Tag significant content strategy decisions in git commits
   - Use commit messages to track sync operations ("Updated profile → website")
   - Consider branch strategy for major content overhauls

#### 🚀 Long-Term Strategic Considerations (6+ Months)

9. **Content Expansion Strategy**
   - **Option A**: Keep minimalist approach, maintain 30% utilization
   - **Option B**: Expand website to show more achievements (move toward 40-50%)
   - **Option C**: Add "Full Resume" link that displays abe-diaz-profile.md content
   - **Decision point**: What serves personal brand goals best?

10. **Multi-Format Content Strategy**
    - Consider: PDF resume generated from abe-diaz-profile.md
    - Consider: LinkedIn profile sync strategy
    - Consider: Speaking bio variations for different contexts
    - All would use abe-diaz-profile.md as authoritative source

11. **Content Management System Evaluation**
    - If update frequency increases, consider:
      - Static site generator with content separation
      - Templating system for consistent updates
      - Build process that validates content sync
    - Current manual approach works for low-frequency updates

12. **Establish Content Review Cadence**
    - **Annual**: Full content strategy review
    - **Bi-annual**: Website design and content philosophy alignment
    - **Quarterly**: LinkedIn, website, profile.md consistency check
    - **As-needed**: Job changes, major achievements, press coverage

#### 📊 Success Metrics for Content Strategy

**Measure effectiveness by:**
- ✅ Zero discrepancies between authoritative source and website
- ✅ All updates synchronized within 24-hour window
- ✅ Clear documentation of all content decisions
- ✅ No confusion about which source is authoritative
