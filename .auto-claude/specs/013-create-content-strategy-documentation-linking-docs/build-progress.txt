# Build Progress - Content Strategy Documentation

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ Phase 1: Research & Analysis

#### 1.1 - Analyze docs/abe-diaz-profile.md content structure
**Status:** Completed
**Findings:**
- Documented all 11 sections of abe-diaz-profile.md
- Sections: Identity, Professional Summary, Impact & Achievements, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Open Source, Volunteering, Press & Publications, Personal, and Social Links
- Profile contains comprehensive professional data including quantified achievements, detailed timeline, and full skills taxonomy

#### 1.2 - Analyze index.html content sections
**Status:** Completed
**Findings:**
- Documented all 11 content sections of index.html
- Sections: Meta/SEO, Design System, Header, About Me, Introduction, Profile Image, Main Bio, Social CTA, Likes/Interests, Flight Stats, Contact Footer
- Identified 3 key discrepancies:
  1. Outdated role title in meta description and bio
  2. Missing GitHub link on website
  3. Significant content gaps between minimalist website (~30% usage) and comprehensive profile.md (100% data)

#### 1.3 - Create content mapping between docs/ and website
**Status:** Completed
**Deliverable:** Created content-mapping-analysis.md
**Key Findings:**
- Line-by-line mapping showing which content from profile.md appears in index.html
- ~70% of profile content is unused (intentionally following minimalist philosophy)
- Critical discrepancy: Job title mismatch (profile shows "Sr. Manager - Disaster Relief" as of Feb 2025, but website still shows "Sr. Technical Program Manager")
- Content strategy: Website follows minimalist personal narrative (30% usage) vs profile's comprehensive resume approach (100% data)

### ✅ Phase 2: Content Strategy Documentation

#### 2.1 - Create docs/CONTENT-STRATEGY.md
**Status:** Completed
**Deliverable:** docs/CONTENT-STRATEGY.md created with all required sections
**Sections Included:**
- Overview: Content philosophy and dual-strategy approach
- Content Sources: Authoritative source documentation
- Version History: Current version and known issues (including critical job title discrepancy)
- Website Section Mapping: Detailed mapping with ~30% utilization rate
- Maintenance Guidelines: Source of truth hierarchy, update workflows, best practices

#### 2.2 - Document content source of truth
**Status:** Completed
**Enhancement:** Added to CONTENT-STRATEGY.md
**Key Features:**
- Prominent "Source of Truth: Quick Reference" section with visual diagram
- Enhanced Content Sources section with explicit authority levels (PRIMARY vs SECONDARY)
- Clear relationship documentation: abe-diaz-profile.md is master record, index.html is derivative work
- Established that profile.md is authoritative for all factual information

#### 2.3 - Create website section-to-docs mapping table
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Deliverable:** Enhanced Website Section Mapping in CONTENT-STRATEGY.md
**What Was Created:**

1. **Complete Website-to-Docs Mapping Table (34 rows)**
   - Numbered table mapping EVERY content element on the website
   - Columns: #, Website Section, Website Content, HTML Location, Docs Source, Profile Section, Alignment, Notes
   - Organized by sections: Header & Navigation, Meta & SEO, About Me, Main Bio, Social CTA, Likes/Interests, Flight Stats, Contact Footer
   - Shows 32/34 elements sourced from abe-diaz-profile.md (94%)
   - Identifies 2 custom elements (navigation, section headers)
   - Flags 2 outdated elements (job title discrepancies)

2. **Content Available in Docs But NOT on Website (detailed breakdown)**
   - Organized by profile sections with tables for each category
   - Identity & Branding: 1 unused element (languages)
   - Professional Impact: 6 unused elements (achievements, awards, partnerships)
   - Work Experience Timeline: 5 unused elements (dates, older roles, technical details)
   - Education Details: 2 unused elements (graduation years, activities)
   - Skills Taxonomy: 3 unused categories (core, technical, soft skills)
   - Open Source Portfolio: 4 projects completely excluded
   - Volunteering History: 3 roles not mentioned
   - Press & Publications: 3 media mentions excluded
   - Social Media: 1 missing link (GitHub - should be added)
   - Total: ~28 content elements (70% of profile content)

3. **Summary Statistics**
   - Website Utilization: 34 content elements total, 32 from profile (94%)
   - Profile Content NOT Used: Detailed breakdown showing 28+ elements
   - Clear percentages and categorization

**Alignment Status Summary:**
- ✅ Match: 30 elements correctly aligned
- ⚠️ Outdated: 2 elements need updates (job title in meta and bio)
- ❌ Missing: 1 element (GitHub link should be considered)
- Custom: 2 elements (navigation, headers)

**Key Insights:**
- The mapping provides line-by-line traceability from website to source
- Every content element is accounted for with HTML line numbers
- Unused content is documented with reasons for exclusion
- The table supports maintenance by showing exactly where each piece of content originates
- Discrepancies are clearly flagged for action

## Next Steps

### Pending: Phase 2 (continued)
- **2.4** - Document content update workflow (small effort)

### Pending: Phase 3 - Validation & Cleanup
- **3.1** - Review documentation for accuracy (small effort)
- **3.2** - Update build-progress.txt with completion notes (small effort)

## Notes & Observations

### Content Strategy Insights
1. **Minimalist Philosophy**: The website intentionally shows only 30% of available content, focusing on narrative over data
2. **Source of Truth**: abe-diaz-profile.md is established as the authoritative source for all professional information
3. **Maintenance Challenge**: Job title needs to be updated across multiple locations (meta description, bio paragraph)
4. **Strategic Opportunity**: GitHub link from profile could enhance developer presence on website

### Documentation Quality
- All mapping tables include specific line numbers for easy reference
- Alignment status uses consistent emoji indicators (✅ ⚠️ ❌)
- Reasons for exclusion provide context for future decisions
- Tables support both maintenance (what to update) and strategy (what to potentially add)

### Technical Implementation
- Comprehensive mapping enables automated content sync in the future
- Clear traceability between sources and outputs
- Documentation structure supports both human readers and potential tooling
