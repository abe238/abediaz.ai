# Build Progress - Content Strategy Documentation

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ Phase 1: Research & Analysis

#### 1.1 - Analyze docs/abe-diaz-profile.md content structure
**Status:** Completed
**Findings:**
- Documented all 11 sections of abe-diaz-profile.md
- Sections: Identity, Professional Summary, Impact & Achievements, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Open Source, Volunteering, Press & Publications, Personal, and Social Links
- Profile contains comprehensive professional data including quantified achievements, detailed timeline, and full skills taxonomy

#### 1.2 - Analyze index.html content sections
**Status:** Completed
**Findings:**
- Documented all 11 content sections of index.html

- Identified 3 key discrepancies:
  1. Outdated role title in meta description and bio
  2. Missing GitHub link on website
  3. Significant content gaps between minimalist website (~30% usage) and comprehensive profile.md (100% data)

#### 1.3 - Create content mapping between docs/ and website
**Status:** Completed
**Deliverable:** Created content-mapping-analysis.md
**Key Findings:**
- Line-by-line mapping showing which content from profile.md appears in index.html
- ~70% of profile content is unused (intentionally following minimalist philosophy)
- Critical discrepancy: Job title mismatch (profile shows "Sr. Manager - Disaster Relief" as of Feb 2025, but website still shows "Sr. Technical Program Manager")
- Content strategy: Website follows minimalist personal narrative (30% usage) vs profile's comprehensive resume approach (100% data)

### ✅ Phase 2: Content Strategy Documentation

#### 2.2 - Document content source of truth
**Status:** Completed
**Enhancement:** Added to CONTENT-STRATEGY.md

#### 2.3 - Create website section-to-docs mapping table
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Deliverable:** Enhanced Website Section Mapping in CONTENT-STRATEGY.md
**What Was Created:**

1. **Complete Website-to-Docs Mapping Table (34 rows)**
   - Numbered table mapping EVERY content element on the website
   - Columns: #, Website Section, Website Content, HTML Location, Docs Source, Profile Section, Alignment, Notes
   - Organized by sections: Header & Navigation, Meta & SEO, About Me, Main Bio, Social CTA, Likes/Interests, Flight Stats, Contact Footer
   - Shows 32/34 elements sourced from abe-diaz-profile.md (94%)
   - Identifies 2 custom elements (navigation, section headers)
   - Flags 2 outdated elements (job title discrepancies)

2. **Content Available in Docs But NOT on Website (detailed breakdown)**
   - Organized by profile sections with tables for each category
   - Identity & Branding: 1 unused element (languages)
   - Professional Impact: 6 unused elements (achievements, awards, partnerships)
   - Work Experience Timeline: 5 unused elements (dates, older roles, technical details)
   - Education Details: 2 unused elements (graduation years, activities)
   - Skills Taxonomy: 3 unused categories (core, technical, soft skills)
   - Open Source Portfolio: 4 projects completely excluded
   - Volunteering History: 3 roles not mentioned

   - Total: ~28 content elements (70% of profile content)

3. **Summary Statistics**
   - Website Utilization: 34 content elements total, 32 from profile (94%)
   - Profile Content NOT Used: Detailed breakdown showing 28+ elements
   - Clear percentages and categorization

**Alignment Status Summary:**
- ✅ Match: 30 elements correctly aligned
- ⚠️ Outdated: 2 elements need updates (job title in meta and bio)
- ❌ Missing: 1 element (GitHub link should be considered)
- Custom: 2 elements (navigation, headers)

**Key Insights:**
- The mapping provides line-by-line traceability from website to source
- Every content element is accounted for with HTML line numbers
- Unused content is documented with reasons for exclusion
- The table supports maintenance by showing exactly where each piece of content originates
- Discrepancies are clearly flagged for action

#### 2.4 - Document content update workflow
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Deliverable:** Enhanced CONTENT-STRATEGY.md with Content Update Priority & Sequencing section
**What Was Created:**

1. **Decision Tree for Update Order**
   - Visual diagram showing when to update docs first vs. website first
   - Three distinct workflows based on content type: Factual, Creative, Emergency
   - TL;DR summary: Factual → docs first, Creative → website first, always sync within 24 hours

2. **Scenario 1: Factual/Professional Updates → DOCS FIRST**
   - Update order: abe-diaz-profile.md → index.html → Verify alignment
   - When to use: Job titles, work experience, education, achievements, press, skills
   - Why docs first: Establishes authoritative record before public presentation
   - Step-by-step process with 3-step workflow
   - Real example: Promotion to "Senior Manager - Disaster Relief"

3. **Scenario 2: Creative/Personal Updates → WEBSITE FIRST**
   - Update order: index.html → abe-diaz-profile.md → Document change
   - When to use: Personal interests, creative bio text, design changes, philosophy statements
   - Why website first: Public presentation layer, allows experimentation
   - Step-by-step process with 3-step workflow
   - Real example: Adding "Sailing" to Likes section

4. **Scenario 3: Critical Corrections → WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY**
   - Update order: index.html (immediate) → abe-diaz-profile.md (within 1 hour) → Document
   - When to use: Factual errors, broken links, misinformation, privacy/security issues
   - Why website first: Highest visibility, minimize duration of incorrect information
   - Step-by-step process with 3-step workflow
   - Real example: Correcting employer name after acquisition

5. **Keeping Content in Sync: Best Practices**
   - Daily habits: Update in pairs, use mapping table, commit with context, set reminders
   - Weekly habits: Spot check alignment, test links, review known issues
   - Monthly habits: Full content audit, update version history, check external sources
   - Quarterly habits: Strategic review, philosophy check, link rot scan
   - Annual habits: Complete overhaul review, archive old content, redesign consideration

6. **Content Synchronization Checklist**
   - Before Making Changes: Identify type, determine order, review mapping, check SEO
   - During Updates: Update primary first, transform content, maintain facts, update dates
   - After Updates: Sync secondary within 24 hours, verify facts, test links, document
   - Quality Verification: Spelling/grammar, factual accuracy, link testing, responsive design

7. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
   - 7 DON'Ts: Don't update one source without the other, don't skip documentation, etc.
   - 7 DOs: Follow decision tree, set reminders, use git audit trail, review mapping

8. **Troubleshooting Common Sync Issues**
   - Issue: "Forgot to update the docs" → Solution: Set calendar reminders
   - Issue: "Content drifted, don't know which is correct" → Solution: Use LinkedIn as tiebreaker
   - Issue: "Creative change feels out of sync" → Solution: Remember different purposes
   - Issue: "Too many discrepancies" → Solution: 5-step recovery process

**Impact:**
- Provides clear, actionable guidelines for maintaining content consistency
- Eliminates ambiguity about update order (docs first vs. website first)
- Establishes best practices for daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/annual maintenance
- Reduces risk of content drift between authoritative source and public presentation
- Creates troubleshooting guide for common sync problems
- Supports long-term content quality and accuracy

**Statistics:**
- Added 341 lines of workflow documentation
- 3 detailed scenarios with step-by-step processes
- 3 real-world examples with specific line numbers
- 5 frequency-based best practice categories
- 4 troubleshooting guides with solutions and prevention

## Notes & Observations

### Content Strategy Insights
1. **Minimalist Philosophy**: The website intentionally shows only 30% of available content, focusing on narrative over data
2. **Source of Truth**: abe-diaz-profile.md is established as the authoritative source for all professional information
3. **Maintenance Challenge**: Job title needs to be updated across multiple locations (meta description, bio paragraph)
4. **Strategic Opportunity**: GitHub link from profile could enhance developer presence on website

### Documentation Quality
- All mapping tables include specific line numbers for easy reference
- Alignment status uses consistent emoji indicators (✅ ⚠️ ❌)
- Reasons for exclusion provide context for future decisions
- Tables support both maintenance (what to update) and strategy (what to potentially add)

### Technical Implementation
- Comprehensive mapping enables automated content sync in the future
- Clear traceability between sources and outputs
- Documentation structure supports both human readers and potential tooling
