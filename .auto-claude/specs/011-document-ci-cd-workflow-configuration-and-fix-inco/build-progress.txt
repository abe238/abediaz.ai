## Build Progress - Subtask 1.1

**Status:** Completed ✓

**Subtask:** Simplify deploy.yml for static site

**Changes Made:**
- Verified that the GitHub Actions workflow has been properly simplified
- Removed Node.js setup (actions/setup-node@v4)
- Removed npm install step (npm ci)
- Removed npm build step (npm run build)
- Changed upload path from ./dist to . (root directory)

**Verification:**
✓ Workflow no longer references Node.js or npm
✓ Workflow uploads root directory (.) as artifact
✓ Workflow maintains GitHub Pages deployment functionality

**Original workflow issues:**
- Referenced npm commands (npm ci, npm run build)
- Required package.json which doesn't exist in this static site
- Would fail on every push

**Fixed workflow:**
- Clean static site deployment
- No build dependencies
- Uploads entire root directory for GitHub Pages

**Next Steps:**
- Subtask 1.2: Verify workflow syntax
- Phase 2: Add deployment documentation
