# Add Structured Data JSON-LD for Person Schema

## Overview

Add Schema.org Person structured data using JSON-LD format in the <head> section. Improves search engine understanding and enables rich snippets for the profile.

## Rationale

The <head> section already has structured metadata (Open Graph, Twitter Cards). JSON-LD extends this same pattern for search engines. All the data needed (name, job title, employer, social links, image) is already in the HTML content.
