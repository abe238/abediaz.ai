# Add Print Stylesheet

## Overview

Add print-optimized CSS using @media print. Hides navigation, adjusts typography for paper, ensures links are readable, and optimizes layout for printing the resume/profile page.

## Rationale

The responsive @media query pattern is already established (tablet, mobile, small phones). Adding @media print follows the exact same pattern structure. For a portfolio targeting recruiters, printability is valuable.
