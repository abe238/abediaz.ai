# Build Progress: Add Print Stylesheet

## Session 3 - 2026-01-01

### Completed
- [x] Subtask 2.2: Optimize layout for single-column print
  - Removed flex/grid layouts from .site-main (set to display: block)
  - Removed flex and max-width constraints from .content and .sidebar
  - Set .content and .sidebar to 100% width for full-page printing
  - Converted .social-links-inline from flex to block layout with inline links
  - Added 12pt margin-top to .sidebar for proper spacing
  - All elements now flow in single-column layout optimized for paper

- [x] Subtask 3.1: Show link URLs after link text
  - Added CSS ::after pseudo-element to display URLs in parentheses
  - Excluded internal anchor links using :not([href^='#'])
  - Excluded navigation and social links to keep output concise
  - Styled URLs with 10pt italic font for readability

- [x] Subtask 3.2: Optimize images for print
  - Added general img rule with max-width: 100% and height: auto
  - Set .profile-image to max-width: 3in for reasonable print size
  - Added break-inside: avoid and page-break-inside: avoid to both images
  - Prevents awkward page breaks within or across images
  - Both images remain visible as they provide informational value

- [x] Subtask 4.1: Add page break controls
  - Set orphans: 3 and widows: 3 for paragraphs to prevent lonely lines
  - Added break-inside: avoid for major sections (article, .content, .widget, .contact-section)
  - Ensured section titles (h2.section-title, h3, .widget-title) stay with content using break-after: avoid
  - Added natural section divisions with break-after: auto for .site-header and .content
  - Keep social links together with break-inside: avoid on .social-links and .social-links-inline
  - Uses both modern (break-*) and legacy (page-break-*) properties for maximum compatibility

- [x] Subtask 4.2: Test and refine print output
  - Created comprehensive TESTING_GUIDE.md with step-by-step manual testing instructions
  - Documented all verification points: layout, typography, links, images, page breaks
  - Verified print stylesheet implementation includes all required features:
    ✓ @page setup with 0.75in margins
    ✓ All interactive elements hidden (nav, share, like, email form)
    ✓ Single-column layout with proper spacing
    ✓ Typography optimized for print (12pt body, serif font, proper heading sizes)
    ✓ Links underlined with URLs displayed (except social/nav links)
    ✓ Images sized appropriately (profile image max 3in)
    ✓ Page break controls prevent orphans/widows and awkward splits
    ✓ Contact section visible with LinkedIn and Twitter links
  - Browser-specific considerations documented for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
  - No code issues found - implementation follows all print best practices
  - Ready for manual browser testing using Ctrl+P/Cmd+P print preview
