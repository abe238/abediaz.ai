# Add Favicon and Touch Icons

## Overview

Add favicon.ico and Apple touch icons to the site. The <head> section already has meta tags for Open Graph and Twitter but lacks basic browser/tab icons.

## Rationale

The <head> section pattern is well-established with preconnect, meta tags, and link elements. Adding favicon and touch icons follows the same pattern structure. This improves professional appearance and browser bookmark display.
