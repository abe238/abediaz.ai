# Add Skip to Content Link for Screen Readers

## Overview

Add a visually hidden skip link that allows keyboard users to bypass the header navigation

## Rationale

WCAG 2.4.1 requires bypass blocks for keyboard navigation. Without a skip link, screen reader users must tab through all navigation items before reaching main content
