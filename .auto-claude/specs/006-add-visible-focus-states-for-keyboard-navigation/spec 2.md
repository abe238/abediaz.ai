# Add Visible Focus States for Keyboard Navigation

## Overview

Add visible focus indicators to all interactive elements (links, buttons) for keyboard navigation accessibility

## Rationale

The current CSS removes focus outlines on email inputs with 'outline: none' and provides no focus styling for links or buttons. This makes keyboard navigation impossible for users who cannot use a mouse, including those with motor impairments.
