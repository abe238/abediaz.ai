## Phase 1: Design System Focus Variables [COMPLETED]

### ✅ Subtask 1.1: Add focus-related CSS variables to :root [COMPLETED]
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Commit:** b56fa0d

**Implementation:**
Added four CSS custom properties to the :root selector for consistent focus styling:
- `--focus-ring-color: var(--color-teal-500)` - Uses existing teal-500 for consistency with hover states
- `--focus-ring-width: 2px` - Accessible thickness for focus indicators
- `--focus-ring-offset: 2px` - Breathing room between element and focus ring
- `--focus-ring-style: solid` - Consistent focus ring appearance

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✓ Added --focus-ring-color variable using an accessible, high-contrast color (teal-500)
✓ Added --focus-ring-width variable for consistent ring thickness (2px)
✓ Added --focus-ring-offset variable for spacing between element and ring (2px)
✓ Variables complement existing design system colors (teal-500, etc.)

**Notes:**
- Variables placed in the Focus States section after Transitions in :root
- Teal-500 (#36BCAB) provides good contrast and maintains design consistency
- These variables will be used by all subsequent subtasks to ensure uniform focus states
