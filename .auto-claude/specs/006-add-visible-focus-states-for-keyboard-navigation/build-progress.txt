## Phase 1: Design System Focus Variables [COMPLETED]

### ✅ Subtask 1.1: Add focus-related CSS variables to :root [COMPLETED]
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Commit:** b56fa0d

**Implementation:**
Added four CSS custom properties to the :root selector for consistent focus styling:
- `--focus-ring-color: var(--color-teal-500)` - Uses existing teal-500 for consistency with hover states
- `--focus-ring-width: 2px` - Accessible thickness for focus indicators
- `--focus-ring-offset: 2px` - Breathing room between element and focus ring
- `--focus-ring-style: solid` - Consistent focus ring appearance

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✓ Added --focus-ring-color variable using an accessible, high-contrast color (teal-500)
✓ Added --focus-ring-width variable for consistent ring thickness (2px)
✓ Added --focus-ring-offset variable for spacing between element and ring (2px)
✓ Variables complement existing design system colors (teal-500, etc.)

**Notes:**
- Variables placed in the Focus States section after Transitions in :root
- Teal-500 (#36BCAB) provides good contrast and maintains design consistency
- These variables will be used by all subsequent subtasks to ensure uniform focus states

## Phase 2: Base Focus Styles [IN PROGRESS]

### ✅ Subtask 2.1: Add focus styles for base anchor (a) elements [COMPLETED]
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Commit:** 89ae12d

**Implementation:**
Added a:focus-visible rule for all anchor elements with visible focus indicator using CSS custom properties:
- outline: var(--focus-ring-width) var(--focus-ring-style) var(--focus-ring-color)
- outline-offset: var(--focus-ring-offset)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✓ Added a:focus-visible rule with visible focus indicator
✓ Focus style uses the CSS variables from phase 1 (--focus-ring-width, --focus-ring-style, --focus-ring-color, --focus-ring-offset)
✓ Focus style does not interfere with hover states (separate rule)
✓ Uses outline (not box-shadow) for better accessibility tool support

**Notes:**
- Uses :focus-visible pseudo-class which only shows focus indicator for keyboard navigation
- Outline offset provides breathing room between link and focus ring
- Teal color (#36BCAB) provides good contrast for visibility
- Applied to all anchor elements site-wide for consistent keyboard navigation

### ✅ Subtask 2.2: Add focus styles for .accent-link elements [COMPLETED]
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Commit:** beeb24b

**Implementation:**
Added .accent-link:focus-visible rule for accent link elements with visible focus indicator using CSS custom properties:
- outline: var(--focus-ring-width) var(--focus-ring-style) var(--focus-ring-color)
- outline-offset: var(--focus-ring-offset)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✓ Added .accent-link:focus-visible with clear focus indicator
✓ Focus indicator is visible against white background (teal #36BCAB on white)
✓ Works well with the teal text color - consistent with brand colors

**Notes:**
- Uses same CSS variables as base anchor focus styles for consistency
- Teal outline (#36BCAB) provides excellent contrast on white background
- Complements the teal text color (#36BCAB) of accent links
- Applied to all .accent-link elements (LinkedIn, Twitter, external links, etc.)
- Maintains visual consistency across all link types
