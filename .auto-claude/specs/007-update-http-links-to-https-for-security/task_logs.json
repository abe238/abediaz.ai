Born and raised in Puerto Rico; holds a BS in Computer Engineering from the <a href=\"https://uprm.edu/\" class=\"accent-link\">UPR-Mayaguez</a> and a MS in Information Security from Lipscomb University. Worked on mobile technologies for several years including at Deloitte building an enterprise app marketplace with over 40 apps and iPad applications for the top leaders in the company including the CEO. Later joined NBC News as the mobile program manager before joining Amazon. At Amazon I worked on payments, royalties and revenue automation for Prime Video. In 2017 I had the chance to participate as a technical volunteer in <a href=\"https://seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-disaster-response-team-aids-recovery-efforts-from-houston-to-indonesia/\" class=\"accent-link\">filling a plane with relief items for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria</a>. Being able to mobilize the technology, people and resources of Amazon for a cause like this was \"the experience of a lifetime\". After that volunteer opportunity I decided to join the <a href=\"https://amazon.com/disasterrelief\" class=\"accent-link\">Disaster Relief by Amazon</a> team permanently and I'm now in charge of our corporate in-kind donations and mobile disaster pickup points program.</p>\n   577→\n   578→        <p>If you are interested in connecting professionally check out my LinkedIn page <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/abediaz\" class=\"accent-link\">https://linkedin.com/in/abediaz</a>.

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n## ✅ Subtask 3.1 Complete\n\n**Changes Made:**\n- Added `target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` to all 11 external links on lines 576-580 in index.html\n\n**Links Updated:**\n1. UPR-Mayaguez (line 576)\n2. Seattle Times article (line 576)\n3. Amazon Disaster Relief (line 576)\n4. LinkedIn (line 578)\n5. Instagram (line 578)\n6. Twitter (line 578)\n7. JetItUp stats (line 580)\n8. Locust Cider (line 580)\n9. RaspberryPi (line 580)\n10. Ice Baths Wikipedia (line 580)\n11. Contrast Showers (line 580)\n\n**Security Benefits:**\n- `target=\"_blank\"` - Opens external links in new tabs for better UX\n- `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` - Prevents tabnabbing attacks and removes referrer information\n\n**Status:**\n- ✅ All external links now have proper security attributes\n- ✅ Changes committed successfully\n- ✅ Implementation plan updated\n\nThe next subtask (3.2) will add the same security attributes to the footer external links on lines 596-597.",
