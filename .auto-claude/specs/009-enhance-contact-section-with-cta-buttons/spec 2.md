# Enhance Contact Section with CTA Buttons

## Overview

Transform the contact section links into more prominent, button-styled call-to-action elements

## Rationale

The target audience (AI company recruiters) needs a clear way to contact Abe. Currently, contact links are plain text and easily missed. The CSS already defines button styles (.btn, .btn-primary) that are not being used.
