# Document the CSS design system and component architecture

## Overview

The index.html contains an extensive CSS design system with well-organized CSS variables and component styles (500+ lines), but there's no documentation explaining the design decisions, color palette rationale, or component usage patterns.

## Rationale

As the site evolves (multi-page structure, modular CSS planned), having documented design system guidelines will ensure consistency. The current inline CSS has good organization with section comments but lacks a standalone design reference.
