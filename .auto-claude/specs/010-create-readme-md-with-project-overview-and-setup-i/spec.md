# Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions

## Overview

The repository has no README.md file, which is the primary entry point for anyone viewing the project on GitHub. This is critical for a portfolio site targeting AI company recruiters who may check GitHub presence.

## Rationale

A README is the first thing visitors see. For a personal brand site targeting recruiters at Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind, having a professional, well-documented GitHub presence demonstrates attention to detail and technical communication skills. Currently there's no explanation of what the site is, how to run it locally, or how the deployment works.
